                We hold weekly money management sessions. Each week, you will learn something new about different ways to manage 
                your money better. We have money advisors available as well to discuss your finances and what opportunities are 
                available to you. You choose a schedule that works for you. You can come every week, or you can come for the weeks
                you feel will benefit you the most. You can come to as many sessions as you'd like until you're comfortable enough
                to open an account with us. Thank you!!
